# Schnorr Zero-Knowledge Proof Lab

## 🧩 Description
This project implements the **Schnorr Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)** protocol.  
It demonstrates how a prover can prove knowledge of a secret value without revealing it.  
The lab includes:  
- Interactive proof (Prover ↔ Verifier)  
- Cheating attempt simulation  
- Fiat–Shamir non-interactive version  
- Cheating probability experiment
